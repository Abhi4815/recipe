        <p>
            You've been provided with a recipe for magii as raw text, and you need to convert this recipe into a properly marked-up HTML file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recipe should have a primary heading of "Magii Recipe", and it should be divided into two sections, the ingredients and the instructions, with the headings "Ingredients" and "Instructions", respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ingredients are an unordered list with the following contents:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maggie</li>
                <li>Sauce</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <p>The instructions are an ordered list with the following contents:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add magii to boiling water.</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Add sauce to a pan</li>
        <li>Mix cooked magii with sauce.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Note that "Add salt to taste." and "Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally." are in a sub-ordered list under the second instruction.
